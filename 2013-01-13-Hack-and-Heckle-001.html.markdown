Transcription:

<b>Darren</b>: So, Mike, I recently was at the Yow! Conference here in Brisbane.

<b> Mike</b>: How was that?

<b>Darren</b>: It was very good. For those listening who don't know what the Yow! Conference is, it is a several day conference. They have two days of talks and then three days of workshops. It's run annually and they have three streams of talks covering multiple things. They did have a good section on Rubies to start with called Through Ruby Eyes with Gary Bernhardt and Jim Weirich who were talking. They had other ones talking about Big Data, Agile, a bit more on Languages, Product Design, Architecture, DevOps, HTML5, Performance, and stuff on JS, etc. It was a very good conference. I'd really recommend it. Unfortunately I only got to go to the talks so I didn’t get to do any of the sessions, the workshops.

<b>Mike</b>: So what kind of workshops did they have there?

<b>Darren</b>: They had several Ruby workshops. I don't actually have all the workshops at hand at this point.

<b>Mike</b>: Buy the binder, as the conference is gone over. So what did you think of the conference overall?

<b>Darren</b>: I thought the conference was really good. There's not very many conferences in Brisbane, and the fact that it's actually a full, multi-day conference made it quite good. The first day is quite long. It starts at 8:00 AM and I didn't get home until nearly midnight because the reception finished at like half 9:00, and then lots of people from the conference went down to the pub and we all sort of caught up in the pub. I had a good chat with Gary Bernhardt. I also had a good chat with Mike Lee as well.

<b>Mike</b>: Ok, that's cool.

<b>Darren</b>: It was pretty good. There were some architecture ones that were pretty good that I went to as well. And I was quite interested in some of the DevOps. The discussions from the guys at Heroku was interesting.  The presentations themselves are all now available online at the Yow! website.

<b>Mike</b>: Actually, I'll have to have a look at those.

<b>Darren</b>: I'll put it on the show notes, and they're currently going to be releasing the videos from this conference and I will be interested in watching some of the ones I didn’t get to see because it was a multi stream conference, you can only pick one that you want to go to. So sometimes I got a little bit of conference where I’m in one, but I really want to see what's happening in the other one.

<b>Mike</b>: You couldn’t be kind of halfway.

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, there was one on Lambda called The Ultimate Dependency Injection Framework and that was Scala, very heavily Scala.  I'm a big fan of Lambdas but it was very dry and very, very in-depth. He sort of like jumped into Scala code and just walked through Scala code for nearly 15 minutes before he was talking about what it was supposed to do. So that one I was really sitting in there towards the end. It was good, well, it wasn't good; it was ok. But I there was another one on at the same time called Architecture Without an End State by Michael Nygard, and I really heard that one was really good. So I really did have envy at that point.

<b>Mike</b>: But overall it was a worthwhile conference?

<b>Darren</b>: I really recommend anyone in the Queensland area.  The conference itself is also in Sydney and Melbourne.  So anyone in Australia, if you're going to go to one conference this year I think that this is one of the best ones. So I can't wait for the next one.

<b>Mike</b>: But I guess the next one is going to be about in December of next year

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, it’s the same time.

<b>Mike</b>:  It was November was in it?

<b>Darren</b>: Yes. I think it was December. I can’t remember.

<b>Mike</b>: So it's going to be a yearly thing up in Brisbane.

<b>Darren</b>: Yes. Yes. It’s just not a great time of year, just before Christmas. I'm a contractor freelancer, so I work for my own company.  So you don't want to take too much time off just before Christmas break. But apart from that…

<b>Mike</b>: Compromise that daily rate.

<b>Darren</b>: [Laughter] Need that money coming in. I highly recommend it. I might go into some topics a bit later when some of the videos are released. I'll send an email over to you, Mike, and you can have and then we can maybe go through some of those topics in a bit more detail.

<b>Mike</b>: And do you know when these videos are coming out? Is it sometime in the next couple of weeks? Any idea? Have they started coming out now?

<b>Darren</b>: I believe they started coming out now. I’ve been told when we were there by the guy who was running the conference that they should all be out by the end of January. So when people are hearing this, they should hopefully be out. And I'll put a link in the show notes to the Yow!! Website and to where the videos are going to be published.

<b>Mike</b>: Ok, cool.

<b>Darren</b>: One thing that was quite interesting which I know you're interested in is they’re actually pushing quite heavily the RubyConf.  Unfortunately I will not be attending.

<b>Mike</b>: Unfortunately I will. Yes. I've been looking forward to it. As you know it’s the Ruby Conference in February, I think it's the 20th through 22nd, Wednesday through to Friday. I think at the moment they have all the keynote speakers lined up and they have something like 22 talks that have been accepted.  So the keynote speakers are going to be the likes of Dave Thomas, Aaron Patterson, Mike Lindsaar, and Corey Haines. At the moment there are probably about 22 talks that have been accepted, so I'm not going to run through them all. We'll probably put a link to the RubyConf org site on the show notes.

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, I think we should.

<b>Mike</b>: There are some very good guys doing the talks like Charles Nutter, Jeffrey Rosenberg, there are tons of them. So probably not best to go through them all here. I'll actually tell you more about them once I've been to the conference

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, well you can always do a bit of a preshow and a bit of a recap of what's happening. That would be quite interesting, and we’ll go into a bit more depth after the conference, and then hopefully when they release the slides and videos, I'll be able to see

<b>Mike</b>: Well, most of them have their talks already on GitHub. So you can actually get her projects so you can download them and have a look at what they're going to talk about.

<b>Darren</b>: Cool.  We might put that in the show notes and I might have a look at that myself.

<b>Mike</b>: So on the Wednesday which is the 21<sup>st</sup> or the 20<sup>th</sup>, I’m not sure, it's workshop day and it's nothing but workshops. I think there are about 10 workshops to choose from. So I'm going to be attending the JRuby one, High Performance Ruby. It's a talk given by Charles Nutter. So I'm quite looking forward to that. It should be good

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, it should be good. Do you know that's actually done in partnership with the Yow! Conference group?

<b>Mike</b>: I didn’t know. No.

<b>Darren</b>: I thought that was quite interesting.

<b>Mike</b>: Yes. I think there are still tickets selling for this. So if you're really interested to going you should book soon, I think, because I doubt they'll last very much longer.

<b>Darren</b>: I wish I could go myself. I'm waiting on the birth of my next kid.

<b>Mike</b>: Congratulations.

<b>Darren</b>: Yes. I was at the doctors today, everything is going good. But we’re due around the 14<sup>th</sup>, but he said we’ll probably go over until about the 20th. So I'll keep you posted and you keep me posted.

<b>Mike</b>: I will do.

<b>Darren</b>: While we're talking about conferences, a bit unrelated from development, but the Penny Arcade are actually bringing their conference to Australia for the first time as well, which is like comics and just general comic con sort of stuff. And that's in July in Melbourne.  I'm not sure if I'm going to go to that but they're the only conferences so far that I'm really interested in going to this year. Unfortunately I’m going to miss the RubyConf but I'm sure there'll be some more Ruby stuff that I'll be able to attend later in the year.

<b>Mike</b>: I'm sure there will, yes. So what's the Penny Arcade? It's an Expo isn't it?

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, it's an Expo Conference sort of thing. It's aus.paxsite.com. There’s Supernova which is like a comic con sort of thing that they do here and it travels around a bit. Just while we were talking about conferences, it’s just the first time it's coming to Australia. It's the only time I'm really going to mention

<b>Mike</b>: I see. I guess I'd better look it up on Wikipedia. So console gamers and that kind of stuff.

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, it's sort of gaming, sort of techie. I don't know, we may go down probably July time; I’ll have to wait and see. If I do I'll let you know.

<b>Mike</b>: Sounds good.

<b>Darren</b>: I did come across a really useful site. I'm heading back to the UK to visit family and back to Ireland as well to visit the folks to work with the birth of the next kid, and I came across the site called Lanyrd.

<b>Mike</b>: And what is Lanyrd?

<b>Darren</b>: Lanyrd is a conferencing site.  It's trying to collate together all conferences into a singular social networking sort of thing where you get to say you're attending a given conference and you can also see other people who are attending the conference. It’s a good place to find conferences because you can look at them by geographical area. So I was going back, I was going to see if there were any conferences around the same time that I'm heading back, and I just find that that site was a very good place to look up conferences if you weren't entirely sure when things were going to be happening. Now it's not an exhaustive list; there are conferences that it doesn't cover. But Yow! was on it, all the big ones are there. It's a site I definitely would recommend checking out.

<b>Mike</b>: So it's mainly for professional topics, developers, that kind of stuff? It's everything, isn’t it?  I’m just looking at it now, yes.

<b>Darren</b>: It's a bit of everything. I was using it for the Yow! Conference as well. I noticed a few people. I don't think it's a big uptake but I just thought it was quite useful, especially if you're traveling to other areas that you may have a look. One conference that I have on the list to do is go to the Aloha Ruby Conference in Hawaii. My wife's been at me for a few years that she wants to go to Hawaii on holidays so I might as well kill two birds with the one stone is what I'm thinking.

<b>Mike</b>: I think so. I think James Evergray went there in just the last few months, wasn't it?

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, I think Aaron Patterson did the keynote. Most of those videos are up online for anyone who wants to see those too. We can put a link in the show notes.

<b>Mike</b>: Yes, that would be interesting.

<b>Darren</b>: So there's a regular Brisbane meetup.

<b>Mike</b>: Yes, a Ruby and Rails one, I think that's at the end of this month.  This month they have the Silicon Beach Gold Coast ones, there's Brisbane Web Tech. I've only really been to the Ruby and Rails, and I guess you've been to a couple of those haven't you?

<b>Darren</b>: I've been to a couple, yes. The JVM Group does a Monday lunchtime meetup which is quite useful if you're in the city in Brisbane.  It's mostly over at SunCorp.  Steve Dalton used to run it I think. But I think he's now back down at the Gold Coast, so he's now setting up a new meetup there in the Gold Coast for Java people

<b>Mike</b>: Yes, there's somebody else running that Silicone one now.

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, I haven't had a look at it.  I haven't been for a few weeks; well actually I haven't been for a while, more than a few weeks. But I do intend to head back to the JVM one. I'm just not in commutable distance for the lunchtime one.  But for anyone in and around the Brisbane City, those lunch time meetups are quite handy because they're quite easy to fit in.

<b>Mike</b>: Yes, they are, and they're very worthwhile.  It's worthwhile getting involved in the topics you're interested in

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, I really like the Brisbane Ruby meetup, I think that's a good meetup

<b>Mike</b>: News from a couple of months ago, Braintree Payments, they are now in Australia although I think they’re promoting themselves as the fastest growing payments platform for online and mobile commerce.  I think they're now across 30 odd countries across the world. For Australia, this is a great thing.  It allows developers to setup their automatic payments for all different currencies.

<b>Darren</b>: They do recursive payments as well, subscription stuff, don't they?

<b>Mike</b>: They do, yes.  I think they're trying to take on PayPal and the banks and the likes of that. But it's been the first time that startups in Australia can actually accept payments from foreign currencies. Previously it's been a real pain in the ass to do it.

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, there's been a lot of sort of payment services, but they're not available outside the US and Europe.  So here in Australia we've been a bit left out.  But I noticed that the Braintree payments, I think they sponsored the last Ruby meetup or something like that. Did they?

<b>Mike</b>: I didn't catch on to that one.

<b>Darren</b>: I remember them sponsoring something recently.  I think they sponsored BrisRuby Christmas Drinks.

<b>Mike</b>: I didn't go to that, maybe that's why.

<b>Darren</b>: But PayPal still works.  PayPal is fine.

<b>Mike</b>: PayPal still works, but, you know.

<b>Darren</b>: My only issue is that it depends on your legal structure.  I know someone who had a family trust structure here in Australia which is a legal entity, and they weren't able to setup a PayPal account which was a bit frustrating.  So they weren't able to do their online payments through PayPal.

<b>Mike</b>: Yes. I think for startups and such, this is really welcomed because there's never been a way to do this properly before. It allows startup companies to integrate payment systems very quickly with Braintree.

<b>Darren</b>: Doesn’t it have some ruby samples, some java samples, etc.? I'm pretty certain. I think I checked them out before. They've got some examples of how to drop it in. I think it only takes like about an hour, an hour and 1/2 to setup the account and connect it all in. Talking about payment accounts, there's a new boy on the scene, well he’s not even on the scene yet, called Pin.net.au, and it’s invite only, still in beta at this point. I think they’re modeling themselves on Stripe, which is another payment service in the US.  It's pretty good but I haven't got into it yet. I've signed up for an invite but I haven't enabled.

<b>Mike</b>: So Pin.net.au?

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, I'll put a link in the show notes. They seem very, very similar to Stripe, which I’ve also used. Stripe is very, very easy as well. They resolve the issue of PCI compliance which is the main killer with credit card processing by sending the credit card information encrypted to their servers, and then when you get back a token. So you don't actually store any credit card stuff.  So you just completely bypass the PCI compliant stuff which just makes payment so much easier. I think Braintree does the same thing

<b>Mike</b>: Braintree does do the same thing. They are PCI compliant, yes.

<b>Darren</b>: Yes. You can also store a customer token and then setup recurring billing and stuff. So that's why it makes integrating to these payment services so much easier than previously. Stripe is also quite useful but you have to be a US account to accept payments. So people from Australia could build it but at the end of the day they'd need to be building it for a US based citizen or company to receive the actual payments. Braintree is the only one which is open and available right now that's an alternative to PayPal that's easy and good to use, and I look forward to Pin when it comes.

<b>Mike</b>: I'm going to have to look a Pin, but yes, I'd say Braintree is great for Australian startup companies. We now have a way of paying overseas foreign currencies which is great.

<b>Darren</b>: Yes. One thing I would highlight, I think there is a monthly fee for using Braintree. I think they've got like a developer mode, I'm not 100% certain. Stripe is a strip payment, and I think Pin is going to be a strip payment.  They just take a percentage of income. So we sort of need to have a look at them when they’re all available and see which is the best option depending on the money that you're going through because I did come across a site but it was an American site that went through Braintree and Stripe and Recurly, and they had sort of a little slider that showed when you charged a certain amount which one was the most cost effective to use. They continually change prices so it's very hard. It takes a little while to figure out which is the best option for you.

<b>Mike</b>: Yes. So also on the subject of companies coming to Australia, we've also got Amazon Web Services. They finally came in November 2012, about two months ago. They finally have presence in Australia now.

<b>Darren</b>: That's great. They're based in Sydney?

<b>Mike</b>: I don't think it's their own datacenter, I think they found someone else’s datacenters for the moment. But finally, as I said, we have Amazon Web Services in Australia. The prices are slightly more expensive than the rest of the world but we're only talking a couple of cents per hour or month I think it is

<b>Darren</b>: Well, that's good news because there's been a few incidents when I wanted to use Amazon in the past and because they weren’t located here in Australia they've been sort of pushed offhand.

<b>Mike</b>: Yes, and I think from a latency point of view as well, it's all going to get better. Being so much closer in Australia, the latency back into the US and stuff can be bad. So having a local presence in Sydney is going to be good for companies.

<b>Darren</b>: If you're running a little app or something on Amazon, if you can move it over to an Australian, you're going to be able to get a lot better ping and a lot better performance especially if it’s targeted here.

<b>Mike</b>: Absolutely. Yes. So on the back of Amazon having a presence in Australia, we also have Rackspace. They’re also in a Sydney datacenter. I haven't actually read much about it, I only read the article on register. But they came in November as well.

<b>Darren</b>: That's good because those two are the main two competitors in regards to price.

<b>Mike</b>: Have you actually used Rackspace?

<b>Darren</b>: I haven't had a good go with them

<b>Mike</b>: I find them very pricey.

<b>Darren</b>: I think one thing that they were doing is you were only paying for storage, something about you weren’t being paid for traffic. So you were in there for like an S3 bucket storage offering.  I think AWS was charging you for storage plus access and Rackspace was just doing straight storage. There seems to be a to and fro between which one is most cost effective between these two.

<b>Mike</b>: Yes. I don't know, I use a combination of VPSs plus AWS. If you ever sign up and run it all the time, I think probably a VPS is probably cheaper.

<b>Darren</b>: It could be.

<b>Mike</b>: AWS or an EC2 Instance.

<b>Darren</b>: I have my site as a Word Press site running on the EC2 Instance.

<b>Mike</b>: How much does that cost you a month just out of interest?

<b>Darren</b>: I don't know, probably less than $10 I'd say per month.

<b>Mike</b>: Ok.  It's cheaper than my VPS then.

<b>Darren</b>: It just depends on what you do and how much traffic you're getting and stuff.

<b>Mike</b>: Yes.

<b>Darren</b>: But I know that there are a lot of libraries. See, Rackspace framework is based on an open source stack, so I think there's a lot of compatibility that you can have, where AWS has got it's on proprietary. But in saying that, because it's so big there's a ton of libraries and that's the big thing and the reason I'm so happy to get them here is the fact that using Ruby, you've got carrier wave and fog and stuff for doing file uploads. You connect in fog, which is another jam, and then you give your storage providers AWS and bang there you go. A couple of minutes and then you're uploading straight to an S3 bucket.

<b>Mike</b>: And likewise with Ruby as you've briefly mentioned, there are a ton of jams that allow you to build and deploy your instances in fractions of seconds type thing.

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, you get that rubber and stuff which is very good...

<b>Mike</b>: It's very well sported.

<b>Darren</b>: We might have a discussion about that later. There are Java libraries as well. But I did do a posting about this in August just before they arrived.  I'll put it in the show notes for my company website that goes into a bit about the AWS and Rackspace coming.  I'm glad they're finally here and I think I also mentioned Ninefold as well which was a local provider. They're quite big in the local scene, but if you want a full write up of more of the Australian local clouds, there is a posting on ZDnet, I'll put it in the show notes from September of last year that goes through all of the cloud providers and gives you a good discussion

<b>Mike</b>: It sounds good, yes.

<b>Darren</b>: But unfortunately, Heroku, even though it's based on AWS is still only in the US at this point.

<b>Darren</b>: As far as I'm aware, they're still only in the US.  But their free tier is just great in regards to spinning up instances and doing some development.  A lot of providers don't give you that same free tier. So if you're spinning up lots of instances, Heroku can be one of the better places to be operating but it may not be the cheapest or the best latency for your production systems.

<b>Mike</b>: This is true, yes. I don't know what their plans are to move around the world, because they back off of AWS don't they?

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, they back off of AWS.

<b>Mike</b>: Yes, Heroku is a great service.  It's very easy to use.  If you haven't, you should be using it.

<b>Darren</b>: I like doing my own server configuration and stuff, but when you're just doing straight development work, it's much easier just to use Heroku and then once you get everything done and you're up on your feet and your project is going, at that point then you can decide whether or not you want to move it off to your own VPS and manage it yourself.

<b>Mike</b>: Yes, and I'm a big fan of Postgres, especially more so now with rails is coming in tighter integration with Postgres.  And Heroku is Postgres shot out of the box, so it's just a mixed life, it's very much easier.

<b>Darren</b>: Yes.

<b>Mike</b>: And it's free.  And it scales.

<b>Darren</b>: It's a very good database.

<b>Mike</b>: And it's getting better, yes. I do like the H store extensions that they've added and arrays and such like.

<b>Darren</b>: We might discuss Postgres a bit more in another show.

<b>Mike</b>: I think we should, yes.

<b>Darren</b>: So before we wrap up the cloud discussion, there's one other provider who recently offers Pass service in Australia called Engine Yard who have come on the back of the AWS Sydney offering and now are offering a Pass service inside of Australia.  So for those of you who are on Heroku, you may want to check out Engine Yard.

<b>Mike</b>: They're all coming to Australia, Darren.

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, well Dr. Nick…

<b>Mike</b>: Who's next?

<b>Darren</b>: I don't know.  Dr. Nick

<b>Mike</b>: He works for Engine Yard.

<b>Darren</b>: He works for Engine Yard.  He's actually from Tasmania.

<b>Mike</b>: Ok, I thought he was down in Melbourne.  I thought he was from Melbourne.

<b>Darren</b>: I think he lived in Melbourne for a long time.  He was going on about playing Cricket with Ricky Ponting when Ricky Ponting played in Tasmania when he was a kid. I remember seeing it when Ricky Ponting actually retired he’d mentioned it.

<b>Mike</b>: Ok.

<b>Darren</b>: He's a Tasmanian boy.  I just get to give a shout out to Australia and say we're doing an Australian based podcast with two foreigners.

<b>Mike</b>: [Laughter] Yes, one from Scotland and one from Ireland. Not even English.

<b>Darren</b>: No we're not.  I love saying that. I'm doing my citizenship later this month so I will then be an official Australian citizen even though I've been here for a very long time.  I just never got around to it.

<b>Mike</b>: Congratulations.

<b>Darren</b>: Thanks very much.

<b>Mike</b>: Ok, what else have we got?

<b>Darren</b>: Just picks, if you want to do picks.

<b>Mike</b>: Sorry, I have my new 27 inch iMac.  This is something I've been waiting for since last April.  So it finally arrived over the weekend

<b>Darren</b>: I remember you saying to me that when I bought my new Mac, you were waiting for the iMac then, and still was a long wait.

<b>Mike</b>: I think there have been lots of production problems with these swanky new screens because they're all glued together type thing. So I think there's still a delay of like 4 weeks now for people who ordered them. I must say it's very nice and it's very fast.

<b>Darren</b>: It looks really nice. I've got envy.

<b>Mike</b>: You'll have to come around and look at it.

<b>Darren</b>: Oh, yes. Will do.

<b>Mike</b>: Ok, so it was my birthday about a week ago and my wife surprised me with the new iPad mini.  I had been talking about it because I think they're lovely little devices and I also own the iPad 3. But for reading and consumption and stuff like that, I love the iPad mini because it's just so small and it fits into your hand and you don't have that weight thing going on that you do with the iPad 3 and 4 or whatever.

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, you do get a bit of a sore wrist if you're using it for too long.

<b>Mike</b>: You do.

<b>Darren</b>: I think it's a better factor form

<b>Mike</b>: It is. And people say that's what it should have been when it first came out. But  it probably wasn't ready at that stage.

<b>Darren</b>: I had a 7 inch android tablet for several years now. It's a great form, it's just the tablet itself.  Mine is pretty old and it's in a box now because it's that old. I do have an iPad 3. I was a little annoyed that they released an iPad 4 straightaway, well 6 months later, but that's the way it goes.

<b>Mike</b>: You and me both.  One more pick, it's the Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby. It's a book by Sandi Metz and I think it's very interesting.

<b>Darren</b>: I'll have to put that in the show notes because I've heard good things about that book.  I might have to check it out myself.

<b>Mike</b>: Yes, she's very good.

<b>Darren</b>: So I'll do my picks.

<b>Mike</b>: Go for it.

<b>Darren</b>: My pick is Unotelly, which is Unotelly.com, I'll put the link in the show notes.  And what that is is a DNS provider which actually gets past geo location stuff. And what that means is that after signing up for an account, you do have 30-day free trials so you can try it out before paying, and it only cost me I think about $5 a month with a VPS, VPN thrown in. But what that does is it unblocks the geo location stuff, which is great for us based in Australia because we have basically next to no streaming offerings.  We do have Quickflix which is a bit of crap, and BBC iPlayer, and the rest of it is woeful. Well the SBS on demand iPhone app is not too bad, but it's woeful selections.  So with that service, I've now got Netflix and Hulu Plus setup.  It's great. No need for cable if you ask me anymore

<b>Mike</b>: Like yourself, I think it's a brilliant service.  It just works.

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, I put you on to it.  Everyone I put onto it just loves it.

<b>Mike</b>: Whether you go to the US for Netflix or the UK for the BBC iPlayer…

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, I was watching BBC iPlayer Match of the Day and then after I watched the Match of the day I then flicked over and started watching a show on Netflix.  So finally global video is at reach.

<b>Mike</b>: And it's legal.

<b>Darren</b>: It's a lot more legal than Usenets or Torrents or anything like that.  So I'm a big fan.  It's one of the best things I've come across yet.

<b>Mike</b>: Yes, I completely agree.

<b>Darren</b>: I think that might be it for my picks for today. That's such a good pick. The other picks are Netflix and Hulu Plus, I have them hooked up to my Apple TV 3 which was basically collecting dust in the corner which I picked up thinking I was going to be able to rid it and put it on X-Box Media Center, found out that I couldn't and it just sat there.  And now it's got a new lease of life. So with that device, a wired network and some broadband, you have access to everything.

<b>Mike</b>: Definitely recommend it.  I have exactly the same story. Bought the Apple TV, sat in the corner, never turned it on waiting for it to be hijacked but it didn't happen.

<b>Darren</b>: I also have it running on my PlayStation 3 as well, and it is also on the X-Box, but I think the X-Box you have to setup for X-Box Live which is an additional fee to Microsoft, so they can get stuffed.  Apple TV and PlayStation 3 is all I need, one in the living room, one in the bedroom, it’s great.

<b>Mike</b>: Yes, definitely recommend it.

<b>Darren</b>: Oh, well. I think that we may call that an end. So thank you. I thank you for listening
