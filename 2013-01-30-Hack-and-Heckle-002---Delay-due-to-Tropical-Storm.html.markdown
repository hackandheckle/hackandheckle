Hi Folks,

Unfortunately due to the Tropical Storm hitting Queensland we are unable to bring you an episode this week, I hope you understand and can join us next week, hopefully. My co-host Mike is still currently without power and/or internet after a separate internet outage last week. please bear with us as we return to air.

Kind Regards,

Darren Rogan
