http://resthub.org/spring-stack.html#bootstrap-your-project
Nice stack for Java

It provides a coherent stack based on:

Java (at least JDK6, JDK7 recommended)
Tomcat 7 (RESThub can also be used for non web applications)
Spring 3.1 (reference manual and Javadoc)
SQL and NoSQL Persistence with Spring Data
Logging with SLF4J (manual) and Logback (manual)
Maven 3.0 (complete reference) is the reference build tool used.
It provides the following modules:

resthub-archetypes: project templates (WAR or multi-module layout) to start quickly a new project
resthub-jpa: support for JPA based persistence based on Spring Data, including embedded H2 database for testing
resthub-mongodb: support for MongoDB based on Spring Data
resthub-test: testing stack based on TestNG, Mockito and Fest Assert 2
resthub-web-server: generic REST webservices support based on Spring MVC 3.1 including exception mapping to HTTP status codes
resthub-web-client: simple to use HTTP client based on AyncHttpClient
The whole RESThub 2.0 Spring stack Javadoc is available.
