The Cartesian Co. Argentum is a desktop printer that lets you print circuit boards with the click of a button. With the Argentum, printing circuits is as quick and easy as printing a photo â€“ allowing you to print on the material of your choice.

The Argentum has been successfully funded on Kickstarter and will soon be going in to production. We will also be accepting pre-orders through our web store. Follow us on Twitter and Facebook for updates.
