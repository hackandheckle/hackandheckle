Transcription:
<p align="center"><b>Hack and Heckle Podcast, Ep. 5</b></p>
&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Hello and welcome to Hack and Heckle, Episode number five. In today's show we’ll be discussing gender in computer games, drones, and a job destruction, as well as other Hacker News.  Unfortunately, Mike Mochan is not going to be able to make it tonight. Fortunately, we have Leigh Apelle joining us today. So he will take Mike's place, and hopefully next week we will have Leigh and Mike on the show. Before we move on to other news sections, for people who previously listened they may have heard us talk about payment services. I'd previously mentioned Pin Payments, which is an Australian Service, which is a copy of stripe which is a payment service. The reason I’m mentioning it is the fact that they've actually now went out of their closed beta. I think they’re in fully open access now. But they may just be in open beta. I think they're fully open. The good thing about these ones is they are Australian based. They’re a restful service implementation which takes the credit card information, encrypts that, and then sends it to their site and returns you a token, which bypasses all the PCI compliance stuff, and it’s really, really easy to integrate with. But that is now available to us in Australia. So previously we didn't have one. Braintree opened up a couple months ago. Now Pin has opened. And pricing is now available for that as well, which is, bear with me one second. The pricing is $50 per month, plus 3% and .30 cents of each transaction.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Do we know how that compares to others?

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: The only two ones which are any good for Australian hosted stuff are Braintree Payments and you have Pin, and both of them are $50 a month. Now the thing about Pin is that you do not need to pay a separate merchant account or gateway, so this is a single fee. Whereas with Braintree, you've got a fee, plus then you've got another fee depending on if it's MasterCard or if it's visa. And some of the other ones you have to then have a payment gateway, another merchant who receives that money. And then you get the money off of them. So there's another middleman taking some money.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Well I think anything that makes that whole process simpler is absolutely beneficial, especially to the startups here in Australia. Previously small startups having to deal with the mega lists of like PayPal or any of the others, it's just been an absolute nightmare for them.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: It has.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: So having a company in Australia that you can deal with in Australia and call people in Australia in Australian business hours I think could be very beneficial.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I personally have not used them yet, but it would be a tossup between Pin and Braintree Payments if I had to do a new payment solution at this point. Both are very similar in regards to the integration. But Pin is a direct payment, no other people involved. So I think it may be cheaper in some instances to run through Pin. But I just bring it back up because I've mentioned Pin in a previous podcast. And one other thing as we're talking about previous podcasts, one of Mike's picks last week was actually Flat UI.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes, I did listen to that one.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Well, Flat UI has a DMCA take down request this week and is no longer available.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Really? Who is the DMCA take down a request from, do we know?

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: It's a company saying that they had a very similar - let's have a look - Layer Vault. So they're saying that Flat UI infringes upon theirs.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Upon their IP?

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Upon their IP, saying that it's too similar, that their color palette's the same, the buttons are the same, the artwork. So there's a little bit of a discussion going on at this point.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: So they're saying that maybe it's been stolen or it's just very similar?

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Well, they’re basically saying that it's too similar. So they're saying that they've taken their UI, and they’ve slightly modified it. And they feel that it's still their UI that somebody else has now released.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: It's a really gray area, especially these flat style graphics. All of them are pretty similar. Like the palettes are all very similar. It’s not too bright, not too pronounced. They're all similar. How can you really argue that?

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: How can you prove that it is your IP?

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: That's true as well. It's very difficult when we're talking about color scales and stuff like that because there is the concepts of color theory. So a lot of people have particular palettes in mind around color theories. Like, there are videos available for multiple people around the color wheel and the tri-selection or the two selections with the 90° angles. If you pick this color you should go for that color. So when we take that into consideration, you find a lot of these color palettes actually become quite similar. So it is quite difficult to determine which it is.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I don't know if it's actually down yet. I downloaded a copy of it last week just in case it came down. I’m just raising that because it's got a DCMA against it.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: It could just be scare tactics right? It's going to be extremely hard for them to prove one way or the other whether their copyright was infringed. Copyright means you've actually copied it. It seems to me that it could just be a little scare tactic by this Layer Vault.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: It could be. But what you'll generally find is when it appears to be so, the person who is the third party hosting that data, because it's user data, generally on their own side of caution will remove it and then resolve it and bring it back up again because they don't want to be liable for not responding to a DCMA request. I don't know, I just think it's hard. I've looked at it. Anyone could do something very similar.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes, we're talking about very, very minute things that are very similar. How many different ways can you draw the face of a clock? How many different ways can you draw a little tick symbol? There's not many.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: There's not. There really isn't.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Especially when you're going for this flat design style, the Windows 8 style. And even Google. They've changed all their graphics to be this kind of flat style as well. It seems to be a growing trend in the web design community.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I quite like it. I do. I recently bought Square UI which is like another flat style based on Windows 8 theme, but it does have a few other ones as well.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes, OK.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: But I quite like it.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes, there seems to be a trend to move away from the Apple style icons – I think it’s called skeuomorphic style – where they look quite real and they have almost their reflection on the icon. And now it's moving more towards the flat icons that have no reflection on them which I think seems to be the trend in the design industry.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I think the problem with the shaded icons is if you have multiple formats and scaling, it doesn't look particularly well. I've played around with [INAUDIBLE 8:45] development, and they've got what they call their name PNG. So you create a PNG which is a button. And then you come in and you basically create a line across the horizontal and the vertical, and when it seals it’s only that line. So that column and that row of data should intersect. So you've got four corners which normally are curved corners, that don't change. And then the center will scale out. But when you've got your shading or your gloss effect or your shine effect or whatever you want to call it, it doesn't look as good when you've got a definitive format. When I did some of my web stuff, I basically was able to take out an iPad and draw on the screen, and it’s pixel perfect. You can literally get it completely designed, and then just cut up that picture and there’s your GUI. If you do that on android that's not going to work because of all the different form factors in screen resolutions you can't do that. And I think those flat styles --

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: So that's one of the downsides I guess of the androids open operating system that can run on several different hardware platforms, and Google has really no control over the screen size that any one particular vendor might be producing. Whereas Apple has got that very strict controlled closed environment and they've got perfect control over each of their devices’ screen size.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Yes. And you find that a lot of apps – when you got the new iPhone it was slightly larger – the apps didn’t have that extra width because it was basically a pixel definition. It does make GUIs and androids more complicated unless you just use standard buttons and standard layouts.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes that's interesting. Maybe that's why the web design guys are moving towards that flat style icon and logo design.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: If you look at the Windows eco system, it's a similar one to Google. They’ve got outsourced manufacturing base.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: It could be any monitor size.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: There can be multiple different sizes, and I think that those flat designs actually scale the better.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes, absolutely. I've got one here. It was a Hacker News article and it was a blog post titled “Come and help save posterous from oblivion. Now this one is about posterous. Posterous, is that how you pronounce it? Posterous

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Posterous.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Posterous.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I thought you were talking about that South African woman there for a second [LAUGHTER], I was only joking.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Posterous was a blogging engine and you could send an email and basically that would be your blog post. And it actually got acquired by Twitter I think last year or maybe the year before. And since then, it's basically been dying a very slow death. The guys who worked on it – it was almost as if the acquisition was an [INAUDIBLE 11:59]. They just got the guys who worked on posterous and I guess they're working on other things now. The point of this blog post was a guy who's trying to rally the masses basically to try and preserve all the blog posts, all the information, comments, everything that's been posted to posterous over the last two years.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: So he's not trying to keep the service alive, he's trying to repost the content?

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Exactly. So it's more like an historical archive I suppose, and the blog post talks about how the same thing occurred with Geocities. So when Yahoo acquired Geocities and it started dying a slow death, as many acquired startups do, there was a huge movement within the community to try and preserve all the websites on geocities in it's own right so they could sit there and then people could go back in and view them I guess for historical or archival purposes.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: You know that we've still got the Internet Time Machine, but that's difficult because you have to know what you're looking for before you get there, and then hope that they've got a previous copy. But I don't know how sustainable that is to have the Internet Time Machine.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: How much of the Internet does the Internet Time Machine cover?

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I don't know.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: I know I've heard of it.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I've looked at stuff previously on the Internet Time Machine. I've gone back and had a look to see what things were like. But I don't know how much it actually covers. I know I used to have a few Geocities sites, but when they closed down I just didn't come back to it, back when I was in my [INAUDIBLE 13:43] and all that sort of stuff. When I was geeking out doing level designs and extra packs and all that good stuff. It was all loads of fun, but I had a few sites where I had released my own, you know I used to do the spray paints and stuff. So I had a bunch of those and I had released them and I’d done some of my own level design, and edited some of Apple’s and all that sort of stuff. So I had a few websites for that.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: On Geocities?

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: On Geocities I had them. Yes. They're probably still there. He's got the site there. I can’t even remember what they're called.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: It’s out there. Get some of Darren’s sweet [INAUDIBLE 14:28].

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: For anyone who’s running Candy Stripe one point something. It was before 1.5. I remember it kicking off on Steam because I didn’t want it.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Now I love it.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: It's incredible the dichotomy between the opinion of Steam now and the opinion of Stem when it first came out. Everybody hated it. Everybody disliked the fact that you had to download the game through the internet. Now I don't even buy games in a box store.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: It annoys me if I can't buy it on Steam.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes, absolutely.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Even though I'm not using my Linux machine for gaming, I'm glad that it's now available on Linux with same day releases on a lot of stuff. I'm happy about that. Also the fact that I remember growing up and I had a friend of mine Ronan who has always been a Mac boy from day one. I remember having the first iMac, remember the CRT with the big curvy.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: He had those. They had Macs from what I remember and I used to laugh at them. But he was sort of left out from the game. I think Myst was like the only Mac game you could get, and I'm wildly in to Settlers. I don't know if you remember Settlers.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Settlers, yes. I remember Settlers.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I used to play that for hours. I went back and played that recently.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: I'm not playing any of my old games any more. Not ones that hold a special place in my heart.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: You don't want to remember them. I actually was playing a DOSBox emulator. I’m going to go back – the system clock – to speed the system clock up because the game was just too slow and I couldn't handle how slow it was.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Really? I thought it was because the clock cycles are so fast now that the games run really fast and you had to slow it down in order for the games to work.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: That used to be the case but now, when you do the emulator thing and what clock speed it should be, the clock speed is managed by the emulator not by your hardware. So I had to go in and turn it so it was at the original clock level.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: OK. I guess if it's an emulator then maybe that doesn't apply.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Then I had to turn it up to get the game speed to turn up a bit more because it was just driving me nuts waiting for people to go out and [INAUDIBLE 16:41].

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes. Anyway, I digressed. I guess the main point of this article it's a really interesting look at how someone on the internet can rally a massive amount of people and make something really big happen, a project like this, or even like the Geocities one which happened over 10 years ago now. I think that the internet has really enabled grassroots movements, and made them a lot easier in order to undertake.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: As we're talking about games, I might move on to one of my picks which is a “A dad hacks Donkey Kong for his daughter.” And now Pauline saves rather than Mario saving the princess.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Wow, I didn't see this one.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Did you not see this one?

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: So they replaced the characters in Mario.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: The clip itself is you can see a video clip on the Ars Technica. It's on YouTube. It actually shows that Pauline, who is the woman that Donkey Kong has captured and Mario has to come and save, is now the other way around. So he's changed all the pronouns and all the text as well from male to female in order to correctly have the female as the heroine, and it's great. It's actually something that I feel quite strongly about now as a father of two girls, and that's it, I'm not going to have any more kids hopefully.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: So maybe this is your next project. You've got to find a game with a very strong male character to replace with a female character.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Well, once you actually look at it, you would be surprised how much conditioning there is around movies and games where the male is there to do some task, and then as a reward he sees a damsel in distress when they’re helpless. And it's not something that I personally want to expose my girls to because I want them to think that they don't need a man to save them if you know what I mean.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Absolutely.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: They are more than capable of looking after themselves. I have lots of kudos to this guy. I think it was a fantastic thing to do.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Some really, really laid text editing skills that he's got.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, it must be. I'm guessing he's modified the hex to the ROM or something like.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: He must have done, yes. This reminds me of a similar story of a guy who modified the game Chrono Trigger and he had his girlfriend at the time play it, and he modified the game to actually do his wedding proposal, his marriage proposal in the game. So she was playing it through and started seeing different things in the game that were kind of ringing true to her life. And she thought wow, this is really strange. And she was talking to her boyfriend at the time and saying well this is really odd. This character seems to have some really odd parallels going on here between me and this character. Then it eventually it ended up as his proposal and that's how they got engaged.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I just went down on one knee.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes, just old school. I was the same.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I just did that.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: I don't know that my wife would appreciate the effort that it might would take to do.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: My wife probably would quit the game halfway through and never got to the point.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: That's a good point. That’s a good point, yes.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Chrono Trigger, wasn’t it. I remember.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: It was an easy game.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, I don't think she would have went the whole way through. I really like the fact that it's a strong female character.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: You're right. It's a very good point.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: We had Tomb Raider, but the problem with the female characters in Tomb Raider, with the previous incarnation of Tomb Raider, is they become hyper-sexualized and it’s not so much a role model for a female if you know what I mean. They become an object of desire for a male, which is not what I want. I'm saying I think the new instance of Tomb Raider looks fantastic. It's really good. But it looks a bit like it's Uncharted.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: It’s pretty violent.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Uncharted meets Tomb Raider is what I've heard. I don't think it's a bad thing at all. In that one, she seems to be a normal person again. They've removed that hyper sexualization of Tomb Raider if you know what I mean. They're ridiculously arbitress and all that sort of stuff. It’s just a bit silly. A big fan of this, so big kudos to Mike for doing this game.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Recently there was a news article on ABC, ABC.net.au, and its titled “Drones set for large scale commercial take off.” And it's talking about the CASA, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and what sort of rules and regulations they're going to need to start thinking about when it comes to drones and especially the mass commercialization of drones. As drones are becoming more accessible to businesses and end-users, I think we're going to see a really large increase, not in just hobbyists building their own Quadcopters or their own small UAVs or something like that, but we're going to see businesses start using them. And I can imagine a scenario where you’re receiving your mail via a drone or you’re receiving an order online via a drone or something similar to that.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, well I think there's a lot of things now which may be done through automation, be it self-driving cars or drones in the future. Especially if you've got – let's say we're talking about mail delivery in the bush rather than in the city where a straight line could be a lot more efficient for delivering mail than on the road system. So at that point, the idea of an airborne mail carrier – we’re talking letters here, we’re not talking about parcels – you could easily move those within drones, especially if it's like an electric powered device and solar powered. It's not going to be too far from the future that these air drones may be able to fly so far, sit down and charge, pick back up again, and start flying again. I don't think that they'll be able to gather enough energy to continuously fly if you know what I mean. I'm a backer of Solar Pocket which is a Kickstarter. I actually got a thing from them today, but I'm waiting on a solar pack which is actually a five volt charger with a battery pack from [INAUDIBLE :58] Boards. I can put it basically on the top and it then charges, and it’s got a battery. And that battery also helps with fluctuations of power. And it charges up the battery and it’s a 5 volt battery

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: When did you get that?

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I got it a while ago. I was supposed to build a baby rocker. I told my wife I was going to build a baby rocker.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes, that's how you got the financial approval for that?

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: No, my wife lets me spend a little bit of cash on my own every so often. Like buying a microphone, but then I'm only allowed a certain amount to spend frivolously so I [INAUDIBLE 1:43] and get some motors and stuff.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Being able to power it just through sunlight I think opens up microcontrollers like Dwengo to have way more applications just around the home or commercial applications as well. If you’re powering a drone with a Dwengo microcontroller, having the solar power powering it I guess means if you're able to generate enough power that it can just infinitely stay in the air.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I don't know if they’re at that stage yet but they may get to that stage.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Oh, yes, I'm sure as new battery technologies and new solar cells get developed.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I think it’ll work fine in Australia but not back in Ireland. There's not enough sun [LAUGHTER], unless you get one that can run off of rail power. I think it’s not going to work in some countries.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes, that could be it. Legally for the US, I think recently, they just passed some regulations on the use of drones commercially over there. I think there's a limit to the height of airspace you're allowed to actually operate a drone in. I know there's been a really huge point of contention over the Obama administration in the US and their use of drones internally in the US. So obviously with that comes privacy concerns.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I completely agree with you. The thing that they have is that they don't ask permission to fly drones and other people’s airspace. So what happens when a foreign country starts to fly their drones in our airspace? Especially in countries so wide as Australia where we don't necessarily have the population density to even identify that someone has come in to our airspace necessarily. If they’re small enough, the drones may not even appear on radar.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes for sure. I think there's a lot of implications to the drone technology and the growing commercialization of drone technology. A main topic today that you wanted to bring out which is the automation of jobs and how that impacts. I believe it’s spurred from a blog post.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Yes. I came across this on Hacker News as well called “Confessions of a job destroyer.” I think it's a very good posting.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: He brings out some really good points. It seems like it's almost like a really guilty post. He's guilty about the fact that he is removing jobs especially when in the U.S. and even Australia there’s so much talk about job creation and trying to make more jobs for people who don't currently have jobs. And I guess his point is almost his sole job is to create systems or to build software that removes jobs.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Exactly. I think it's how you look at it and the timeframes you look at it. So in the short term, it creates more jobs because all this automation work is requiring a specialist who is more expensive than the person that they're replacing. So they talk about efficiencies. But efficiencies generally mean that they don’t require the same number of staff because they're more efficient to do a similar amount of work. So if they've got staff leveling to complete certain tasks as the effort to complete those tasks is less therefore they don't need they head numbers.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: That's right. That's the argument. I think there was a comment either on the Hacker News post or the blog post. One of the commenters was saying as a software developer you’re not actually a job destroyer, you're a value creator. So what that company chooses to do with that extra value is up to the company. And ultimately it comes down to the executives or whatever the direction of the company is to leverage that value to cut costs as opposed to redistribute resources.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I can understand where they're coming from because they're saying we’ve freed up some time that they can go use elsewhere. I think that's a little bit naïve, and I can tell you now that when I was working in London, I worked on a project, a DFRA project, Department of Farming and Rural Affairs. And it was a massive organization project. It was almost 200 developers at one stage. It was a very good project. But they did let go of 15,000 staff. They automated mail rooms and claim forms and it was all really well done in regards to a seamless system that mans the entire process. And then they had only some random problems. So they required a lot less staff. I was in a pub one day in London and I happened to mentioned I was working on that project around a person who then happened to be friends with someone else. And he said, “Oh, my friend works at DEFRA.” And I'm like OK. I'm like were you on the project? And actually he’d just been made redundant that day. And he threw his paint in my face and actually wanted to go outside and have a fight. So when people say that we are value creators, at that point, that day, that night, I actually felt really guilty. I felt really, really bad. The only thing I could say is at least the work's being done on shore. And he wanted to kill me when I said that.  I understand why he wanted to kill me. I can relate to this.

<b>Leigh</b>: A lot of work, IT &amp; software development is is removing inefficiencies and automating manual tasks. And I'm sure there are hundreds of tasks that people complete every day who don't have a programming background, and they could if they had the knowledge leverage that programming background to automate a lot of what they do.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: How many people live and work in Excel spreadsheets? Anyone who lives and works in an Excel spreadsheet can be replaced by a computer system.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Sure. Sure.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: There's data entry and then there's processing. We’ve got OCR these days. We can read forms. We can read all the text that goes in the form. Text to speech, we don't have people answering the phones. You talk to a machine who routes you through to an individual which means the call center staff are even less.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: I guess the flip side is and I'm not an economist by any stretch of the imagination but the flip side from an economist perspective is that that efficiency that's gained within whatever sector it is will lead to a greater economy of scale in some cases and then therefore drive prices down to the ultimate consumer. So prices are less because they are having to hire less people. For example, I guess the agriculture one – maybe that affects farming. So farmed goods cost less for people. And I guess whatever skills were there should be redistributed to skills shortages within the economy.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I can understand where that comes from, but I personally believe that we can automate about 70% of the current workforce. That might sound outlandish, but if we just automate 20% of the workforce. Now if you have a look at what I'm talking about, I'm talking about the service jobs. Now I go into the supermarket and Kohls now, I don't even go through a teller. I go through a self-service check out. So I'm going through self-service, I walk in. I basically don't have anyone. The only thing that people are doing now are just stacking the shelves. They're taking stuff out of boxes and they're putting them on shelves. With people doing that.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes, the next step Starbucks doing that, and the robot’s doing that.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I’ve got a robot vacuum cleaner. It goes through the house and vacuums the house. I’ve got a Roomba. It’s fantastic.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes, that’s right. When you think about it that way I think certain trades like building of houses, or maybe that's too intricate to actually use a robot.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: But I disagree because I think what's going to happen is the factory built houses are going to increase. So what's going to happen is with the pre-built house which is now brought onsite and then constructed onsite.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: So are you envisioning a huge factory? Like imagine like cars in Germany

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I'm mad into the factory built houses.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: What is it like a car factory, you know how typically you see the car comes through, the chassis comes through, all these robot arms start putting things into it. But it's just that times 50 and you've got the size of a house.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Correct.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: I never thought of that.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: They don't have any in Australia. But they’re very, very keen in Germany. This one is not robots, its people. But what happens is they’ve basically got trees coming in build the wood panels. And all the sawdust and all that they collect, they treat and they use it as the insulation. And they put the wiring and all in. And they even do the internals. And then they wrap them in plastic and put them on the back of the track. And you've got every side of a house. And then they've got basically an ideally smooth, precise concrete block. And then the sides are done with a wrench with a big crane, and they just bolt in to these bolts at the bottom. And then the whole house is bolted together. And the roof comes in in one piece, and every supporting wall comes in in one piece, and then a lot of the fixtures and fittings have been pre-done, and they're able to put up a house in a week.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes, that sounds amazing. That sounds really, really amazing.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: What that is doing is that’s then centralizing into factories that are making these houses and they're not being affected by weather or anything because they’re indoor making these houses. And then we'll get to the stage where we did with cars that that will then be automated with robots.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Not many people custom build their house these days. There are so many companies out there like Metricon, Divine, all those companies that just have out of the box houses they'll build you for certain price, all the plans are all set.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: If it's so much cheaper when you buy off the plan of a pre-built house. They know exactly what they're doing.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: So then the next step is just making that a factory process. And I'm sure maybe on the way to doing that, they probably build parts of the wall, and they’ve got wall parts already structured.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: In Australia, that they're still doing a construction onsite. So they get the frames and they come in and they're going through still a traditional build. But when they move to Germany or the big ones that prefabricate their houses, and Scandinavian countries to a lesser degree, because I watch Grand Designs and all the like, they are they are prefabricated, and they’re coming back. That’s going to remove --

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: That's going to remove a significant portion of the labor market. None of this stuff is too new. During the industrial era, the huge push for manufacturing and improvement and automation and manufacturing. That put a whole bunch of people out of work in the early 1900s.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: It did.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Putting aside the fact that there are real people who are really losing jobs that have debts to pay and kids to feed, as a society we survive.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, but as a society my concern is more around increasing poverty and separation of the wealthy and the poor, and inequality that will continue to grow because inequality is growing dramatically. And the middle class will reduce as there’s less and less because we can monetize all of the jobs. People say there's still jobs. There are service jobs, making coffee and salesmen and stuff like that, but the salesmen are being replaced. The whole retail sector is being replaced with online shopping.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes, it's happened already multiple times. So I guess this is just one more example.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I just don't know if it’s happened to the same scale which I believe it's going to happen, and I wonder what will happen not for us, I don’t think it’s going to happen in our lifetime, but I think for our kids, what sort of career opportunities are there going to be because there are industries that I think will be dead-end industries.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: There are some that are protected. There is always some level – lawyers are a good example. You’re never going to be on automatic law.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Well, yes and no. The reason lawyers are always required is due to the complexity of the law. But if the laws were simplified, there would be less to argue over. So there's complexity which is involved. Because of that complex today, at that point then there's an opportunity to make money around it.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: We’re digressing quite a bit but the point that he was making is we're destroying medium to high income jobs with automation and they’re being replaced with lower-end jobs. And the increase of multinationals and Wal-Mart and things like that. So it’s driving down prices but it's also driving down wages. But we’ll get to a point that if unemployment gets to a certain point, there will not be people making enough money to be purchasing the goods to keep the flow, because our monetary system is based on a flow of cash. We literally don't have the money that exists. It doesn’t actually exist. It's all electronic. If everyone went and tried to take all of the money out of the bank it wouldn’t exist.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: I think what you’re describing is called stagflation where it’s high unemployment plus inflation which seems counterintuitive but in the scenario you're describing I guess it seems possible. Because people can’t afford to buy the products because they don't have work so the companies are bringing down the prices, but that's not increasing the job market.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: No I think that would end up being an end result. The companies are trying to drive profits by decreasing prices which is priced on the labor market down. So the jobs are getting paid less, and then there's less take home money. And we get into a cycle, as the guy talks about, that we start eating our own tails because we start to affect the money flow because the money flow isn’t available because there's not enough people employed that there is a flow of money to afford it.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes, it’s interesting.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: I think it’s very interesting But the thing that he's talking about is having basically a set income. So a social services set income which enables people to live without work.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Yes. That is the scenario. If we had robots doing everything, that's the scenario you wouldn’t need to end up in.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: The point that he's making is that we do need to move to something like that if we do end up with very high unemployment. Now the unemployment in Australia is very low, less than 5%. But it’s 14% in other countries.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: Wasn’t it 30% in Spain or something like that?

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: Yes, for the under 30. That caused to riots and social disorder. It could happen. We completely digressed from technology here but it could. Well it's called Hack and Heckle. I expect some people to tell me I'm full of crap. If you want to just leave a message and I will try to ignore you. Only joking. If it's valid and it’s not full of swearing, we’ll try to bring it on the show. So we might leave it at that for the topic on Hacker News unless you've got a particular one that you'd like to cover, Leigh.

&nbsp;

<b>Leigh</b>: No, that covers my story that I wanted to talk about.

&nbsp;

<b>Darren</b>: For anyone who’s listening who would like to give us some feedback, it's feedback@HackandHeckle.com. For anyone else you can also check out the website HackandHeckle.com. The show notes and transcriptions of the show are on there. Also you can leave a direct voice feedback via Speak Pipe which is a bit of a plugin directly in the website. So if you've got a question for us or a bit of feedback, you can just jump on the website and leave us a message under 60 seconds and we will try to bring it up in the show.
