<h1 align="left">HACKING HEALTH @HIC in Brisbane</h1>
3-5 August 2015, Brisbane Convention Centre as part of HIC 2015 Conference

<em>Hacking Health @HIC</em> is being run as an integral part of <em>HIC 2015</em>, Australia’s largest e-health, digital health and health informatics event.

Hacking Health @HIC will expose participants to the largest gathering of digital health experts in Australia; with clinicians and others that have real healthcare problems that need innovative approaches to address them. By bringing the community together in this innovative format we aim to provide a forum for participants to work together to address significant healthcare problems and to foster personal relationships and networks that will lead to ongoing collaborations outside of these 3 days.

Health and community care experts, designers, developers, engineers, patients, and mentors will collaborate and co-create solutions and digital health prototypes to pressing healthcare challenges.

HISA is partnering with <a href="http://www.hackinghealth.ca/" target="blank">Hacking Health</a> an internationally recognised Canadian based group who shares our vision to foster collaborative, cross-disciplinary relationships that lead to significant innovation which improves healthcare outcomes.  Hacking Health have delivered events in Toronto, Montreal, Paris, Stockholm, London, Milan, New York, Berlin and now Brisbane!
