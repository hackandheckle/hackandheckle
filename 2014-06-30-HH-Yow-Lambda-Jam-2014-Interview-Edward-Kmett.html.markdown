Edward chairs the Haskell core libraries committee, collaborates with hundreds of other developers on over 150 projects on github, builds tools for quants and traders using the purely-functional programming-language Ermine for S&P Capital IQ, and is obsessed with finding better tools so that seven years from now he won’t be stuck solving the same problems with the same tools he was stuck using seven years ago.
