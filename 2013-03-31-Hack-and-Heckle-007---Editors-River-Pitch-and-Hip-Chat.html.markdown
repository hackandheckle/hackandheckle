<p dir="ltr">“MARTIN FOWLER:  Yep. That has still been my feeling. I still notice I shy away from using the word ‘architecture’ because it does carry a lot of that pretention. And you see that very noticeably in certain communities. Certainly, people around ThoughtWorks tend to be very wary of the word ‘architecture’. Hardly anybody puts architect on their business card. I think and it’s partly sad that that’s happened, it’s partly because of the fact you run into so many people who do use the word ‘architect’ who have really distanced themselves a lot from day to day software development and have lost touch really with what the serious issues are.“</p>
